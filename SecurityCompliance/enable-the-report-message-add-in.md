# Enable the Report Message add-in

> [!NOTE]
> The Report Message add-in for Outlook and Outlook on the web is not exactly the same thing as the [Outlook Junk Email Filter](https://support.office.com/article/Overview-of-the-Junk-Email-Filter-5ae3ea8e-cf41-4fa0-b02a-3b96e21de089), although both can be used to mark email as junk, not junk, or a phishing attempt. The difference is, the Report Message add-in for Outlook and Outlook on the web notifies Microsoft about misclassified email, whereas the Outlook Junk Email Filter is used to organize email messages in a user's mailbox. 

## Overview

The Report Message add-in for Outlook and Outlook on the web enables people to easily report misclassified email, whether safe or malicious, to Microsoft and its affiliates for analysis. Microsoft uses these submissions to improve the effectiveness of email protection technologies. In addition, if your organization is using [Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection Plan 1](office-365-atp.md) or [Plan 2](office-365-ti.md), the Report Message add-in provides your organization's security team with useful information they can use to review and update security policies. 

For example, suppose that people are reporting a lot of messages as phishing. This information surfaces in the [Security Dashboard](security-dashboard.md) and other reports. Your organization's security team can use this information as an indication that anti-phishing policies might need to be updated. Or, if people are reporting a lot of messages that were flagged as junk mail as Not Junk by using the Report Message add-in, your organization's security team might need to adjust [anti-spam policies](configure-the-anti-spam-policies.md). 

The Report Message add-in works with your Office 365 subscription and the following products:
 - Outlook on the web
 - Outlook 2013 SP1
 - Outlook 2016
 - Outlook 2016 for Mac
 - Outlook included with Office 365 ProPlus

Your existing web browser should suffice for the Report Message add-in to work; however, if you notice the add-in is not available or not working as expected, try a different browser.
  
If you're an individual user, you can [enable the Report Message add-in for yourself](#get-the-report-message-add-in-for-yourself). 
  
If you're an Office 365 global administrator or an Exchange Online administrator, and Exchange is configured to use OAuth authentication, you can [enable the Report Message add-in for your organization](#get-and-enable-the-report-message-add-in-for-your-organization). The Report Message Add-In is now available through [Centralized Deployment](https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins).
    
## Get the Report Message add-in for yourself

1. In [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps), search for the [Report Message add-in](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/wa104381180).

3. Review the terms of use and privacy policy. Then choose **Continue**. 
    
4. Sign in to Office 365 using your work or school account (for business use) or your Microsoft account (for personal use).
    
After the add-in is installed and enabled, you'll see the following icons:

## Set up a rule to get a copy of email messages reported by your users

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must be an Exchange Online Administrator to perform this task.
  
You can set up a rule to get a copy of email messages reported by users in your organization. You do this after you have downloaded and enabled the Report Message add-in for your organization.
  
1. In the Exchange admin center, choose **mail flow** \> **rules**. 
    
2. Choose **+** \> **Create a new rule**. 
    
3. In the **Name** box, type a name, such as Submissions.
    
4. In the **Apply this rule if** list, choose **The recipient address includes...**. 
    
5. In the **specify words or phrases** screen, add `junk@office365.microsoft.com`, `not_junk@office365.microsoft.com` and `phish@office365.microsoft.com` then choose **OK**.<br/>![Specify the junk and phish email addresses for the rule](media/018c1833-f336-4333-a45c-f2e8b75cd698.png)<br/>
  
6. In the **Do the following...** list, choose **Bcc the message to...**. 
    
7. Add a global administrator, security administrator, and/or security reader who should receive a copy of each email message that people report to Microsoft, and then choose **OK**.<br/>![Add a global or security administrator to receive a copy of each reported message](media/a91ab9d1-66f2-4a2e-9dc1-f9f81a2298ad.png)<br/>
  
8. Select **Audit this rule with severity level**, and choose **Medium**. 
    
9. Under **Choose a mode for this rule**, choose **Enforce**.<br/>![Set up a rule to get a copy of each reported message](media/f1cd95ce-e40d-4a8a-8f48-893469eba691.png)<br/>
  
10. Choose **Save**. 
    
With this rule in place, whenever someone in your organization reports an email message using the Report Message add-in, your global administrator, security administrator, and/or security reader will receive a copy of that message. This information can enable you to set up or adjust policies, such as [Office 365 ATP Safe Links](atp-safe-links.md) policies, or your [anti-spam](anti-spam-protection.md) settings.
